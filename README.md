This project implement a movie recommendation system using a series of algorithms including item-based collaborative filtering, user-based collaborative filtering, SVD, Restricted Boltzmann Machines(RBMâ€™s) and so on. Developed recommendations computation at large scale with Apache Spark especially MLlib. Also implemented a framework for evaluating different algorithms.
